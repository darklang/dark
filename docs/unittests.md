# Unit tests

## Overview

Unit tests run automatically on the backend, as part of the builder script, if
enabled with `--test`. This is actually super slow, so I wouldn't recommend it.

## Backend

The entry point is `backend/tests/Tests/Tests.fs`. Run tests from the
command line using:

`scripts/run-backend-tests`

Run `scripts/run-backend-tests --help` for options. In particular, to run only
tests with XXX in their names:

`scripts/run-backend-tests --filter-test-case XXX`

Or to run only testlists with XXX in their names:

`scripts/run-backend-tests --filter-test-list XXX`

Tests are _not_ automatically discovered; they must be added to `Tests.fs`.
