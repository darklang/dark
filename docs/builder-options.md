## Other ways to run the dev container

### Just serve it, not constantly recompiling

- Run `scripts/builder --compile --serve`

### (Not) Rebuilding the dev container

If you pull a commit with a Dockerfile update, and then restart your
`scripts/builder` script -- it will rebuild as much of the container as possible.

If you don't want to rebuild the container, use `NEVER_REBUILD_DOCKER=1 scripts/builder ...`
to make the the build script use the last built one.

In another shell you can now kick off a `scripts/builder --compile` to rebuild the container
in parallel with your currently working one.

You can use `export CURRENTLY_REBUILDING_DOCKER=1` to make your run-in-docker invocations, including say ocamlmerlin, use the old+running container as opposed to attempting to use the container
that has an in progress build.

### Preserving battery life

The're a poll during building that is a great drain on battery life. To
reduce the frequency of the poll, run script/builder using
POLL_FREQUENCY, which is the number of times per second to check.

- `POLL_FREQUENCY=0.1 scripts/builder --etc`

You can also disable the polling (and consequently the building):

- `scripts/builder --compile --serve`
