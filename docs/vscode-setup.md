## Setting up VSCode

VSCode's Remote Containers feature works very well with Dark. However, we need
to run things slightly differently to make it work. Instead of using
`./scripts/builder` to run the build, we run the build within the devcontainer.

## Getting started

Install the [Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Note that "Clone into container" does not work at the moment, so first clone the
Dark repo locally.

Open the Dark directory, and when prompted to open it in a container, do so.
The container will build, hopefully without problem.

When asked, install the suggested extensions as they are used to build Dark. We
plan to automatically install the right extensions to build Dark.

## Build output

You should see build output in the VS Code terminal, under the heading "Configuring".
This is also logged to `rundir/logs/build-server.log`

## Extensions

VSCode extensions are installed on a docker volume in the container, which caches them for the next time we need to restart the container. This means that new extensions added to devcontainer.json are not automatically built. If that's needed, you can delete the extensions volume with:

- `docker volume rm darklang-dark-extension-volume darklang-dark-extension-volume-insiders`

## Issues

We are very interested in any issues you might have. Everyone uses VS Code, so we'd
like to make sure the experience is super smooth for everyone. Please report any
issues in Discord.
