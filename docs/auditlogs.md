# Audit logs

We now have Cloud Audit Logs turned on for our storage buckets. To see these
logs, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer and select "GCS Bucket"
from the resource dropdown. You can also further drill down to a specific
bucket.

For more details on why we picked this approach and not access logs, or for
links to docs on exporting these logs to another bucket (for analysis outside of
GCloud), see
