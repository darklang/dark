# Incident Response

hello friendly neighbourhood L3 responder! the engineering team is extremely sorry
for L1+L2 response being AWOL.

### Things to check:
  * Is google cloud down? https://status.cloud.google.com/
    - If so, there's not much we can do unfortunately. Restarting our services will not help
  * The pingdom service which determines if we're up or not hits https://dabblefox-shelf.builtwithdark.com/ping, so you can check this yourself to determine if we're totally down, or only partially down.

### Resolving Issues:

#### Google Cloud Shell

Google helpfully have a web-based shell that you can use anywhere for incident response.
* Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=balmy-ground-195100
* Click "Active Google Cloud Shell" button in top right (it's this button: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q042csiq1ebgzqs/Screenshot%202018-07-17%2016.20.11.png?dl=0)
* Wait for the shell to boot
* Run the following command to finish setup

```
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$(< current-cluster)" --zone=us-west1 --project=balmy-ground-195100
```

#### Checking on the Kubernetes pods:

Run the following command at the cloud shell prompt:

```
$ kubectl get pods
```

You should see something like:

##### Interpreting the 'Status' column

* If everything is mostly 'Running' then Kubernetes thinks the system is healthy. If we're still down, you should try to restart the pods via the section below
* Anything else like Terminating, CrashLoopBackOff etc. indicates that kubernetes knows that the system is unhealthy and is working to fix it

#### Restarting Kubernetes pods:

 Run the following command:

```
$ curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/IanConnolly/5cc6625a54ad7b2c49eff61b52729602/raw/21d7d1af8b2c933669b1cd585af120b31281b96c/force-system-restart | bash
```
