# tests:
# once we have traces working, we could set up tests
# to run both before and after the bootstrapping
#
# Before, we test that the canvas has no handlers
# (to ensure that the resetting of the canvas worked).
#
# After, we test that the canvas has the handlers we expect,
# then hit one of the endpoints,
# and check that we have traces for that endpoint.
