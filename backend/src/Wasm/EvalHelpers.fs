/// Any 'loose' exprs in the source are mapped without context of previous/later exprs
/// so, a binding set in one 'let' will be unavailable in the next expr if evaluated one by one.
///
/// e.g. given these separated exprs:
///   - `let x = 1`
///   - `1+1`
///   - `x+2`
/// when evaluating `x+2`, `x` wouldn't normally exist in the symtable.
///
/// So, this fn reduces the exprs to one expr ensuring bindings are available appropriately
///   `let x = 1 in (let _ = 1+1 in x+2)`
///
/// `1+1` here may just as well be something like
///   `WASM.callJSFunction "console.log" ["X is " ++ (Int.toString x)])`
///
/// (There's no way to read the symtable from `state`, otherwise I'd eval expr by expr, and
/// update the symtable as I go.)
///
/// TODO: this would belong better somewhere else, but I don't know where.
