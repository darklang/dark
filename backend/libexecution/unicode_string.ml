(* General note about operations in this file:
 * [`Grapheme_cluster] is an extended grapheme cluster
 * in accordance with UAX 29 (see https://erratique.ch/software/uuseg/doc/Uuseg/index.html).
 *
 * Performing operations on strings (such as concatenation) may "denormalize" them
 * which means that we have to re-normalize. We use the [`NFC] normalization form,
 * which is the best form used for general text (see http://www.unicode.org/faq/normalization.html#2).
 *
 * For identifiers, [`NFKC] is preferred in situations where there are security concerns
 * due to, for example, visual spoofing. See http://www.unicode.org/faq/normalization.html#2.
 * We do not currently use that form.
 *)

(* This just treats it like any old string, if we have lots of tests that use this
 * we should consider only printing ASCII chars, and outputting hex syntax bytes
 * like "hello, \xfd\xfd" *)
