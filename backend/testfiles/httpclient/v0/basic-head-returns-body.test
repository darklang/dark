Here's a body!


[test]
// HEAD requests aren't supposed to actually return a body. But it seems like the
// clients successfully ignore it.
(let response = (Builtin.HttpClient.request "head" "http://URL" [] Builtin.Bytes.empty) |> unwrap
 let respHeaders = response.headers |> Builtin.List.filter (fun h -> PACKAGE.Darklang.Stdlib.Tuple2.first h != "date")
 {response with headers = respHeaders}) =
   Builtin.HttpClient.Response
    { statusCode = 200
      headers = [
          ("server", "kestrel")
          ("content-length", "15")
          ("content-type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")
      ]
      body = Builtin.Bytes.empty }
