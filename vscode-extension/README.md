# Darklang VS Code Editor Extension

## Local development

- open this dir outside of a vs code devcontainer
- `npm i`
- `f5` to run the extension in a new VS Code window
- Note: when you make changes in this repo, you can refresh the spawned window with ctrl+r to have the latest

## TODOs

- fetch a fake interpreter and dark code
- replace ugly tree view with fancy webview
- add more commands
- figure out 2-way communication
- add some more tests
- get tests running as part of CI
- what should we do with the .vscode directory here?
  I suppose it should be merged with our root-level dir.
