// When a pod is being replaced, scaled down, etc, k8s needs to kill the old pod
// (which is of course active at this point, receiving HTTP requests). It has 2
// mechanisms, which it triggers together: a SIGTERM signal, and a preStop setting.
// (Since we need to handle the SIGTERM signal either way, we don't use the preStop
// setting). Basic explanation here:
// https://blog.markvincze.com/graceful-termination-in-kubernetes-with-asp-net-core/
// https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-terminating-with-grace
//
// After sending these triggers, K8s might keep sending requests though, I'm not
// sure. It certainly did in (old versions of the?) nginx ingress, which we use for
// custom domains.  It kept sending requests until the pod was removed from the load
// balancer, which took moment. So we want to finish existing requests, and also
// possibly new requests. If we don't, we'll get 502s. Discusssed here:
// https://andrewlock.net/deploying-asp-net-core-applications-to-kubernetes-part-11-avoiding-downtime-in-rolling-deployments-by-blocking-sigterm/
//
// Our goal when shutting down is to allow the existing requests to complete, and
// then shutdown. This will prevent requests from dying and the requestor getting
// 502s.
//
// Ideally we would make sure other resources are cleaned up (traces have been
// uploaded, etc), but for now we'll stick to just doing what the OCaml version did,
// which is wait 28 seconds (leaving 2 seconds for the rest of the cleanup).
//
// .NET already knows to shut down when it gets a SIGTERM, after which it will wait
// until all requests are complete before shutting down, subject to timeouts. We want
// to allow an extended timeout of 28 seconds, which is more than the default.
//
// It appears that .NET should support HostOptions.ShutDownTimeout, but that doesn't
// appear to work.
//
// The other way is to do the timeout ourselves. We can register an
// ApplicationStopping callback, and the process will not shutdown until this
// callback returns. Of course, k8s will kill the process after 30s, so it's
// worthwhile to finish a little sooner so that .NET can do other cleanup if needed.
//
// CLEANUP: in the future, we would like to wait:
// - check the rollbars, honeycombs, etc, have been dispatched
// - check the traces have been uploaded
// - shutdown as soon as we're done so the rolling upgrade can complete more quickly.
