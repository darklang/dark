# cloud_sql_proxy notes:
# 1) In theory we could block until this connects and then continue - perhaps
# using `expect` - but in practice, the proxy is quick enough to launch that
# this doesn't seem necessary
#
# 2) This does leave around a cloud_sql_proxy process per invoke of this script.
# If that ends up being a problem, we could try reaping them periodically, or
# perhaps if `ps | grep cloud_sql_proxy | wc -l` is greater than some threshold.
