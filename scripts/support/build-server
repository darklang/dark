# It is extremely challenging to get a non-blocking read on stdin.
# Essentially, we want to read everything from stdin and then compile.
# And if there isn't anything on stdin, sleep for a bit. The best way
# to do that is to read stdin in a separate thread, and every 300ms to
# check what has accumulated. Every other option I tried, including
# termios, epoll, either didn't work, or had a weird edge case. One
# nasty edge case is when you're saving all the time, as my editor is
# configured to do, it processes it one at a time and builds up a huge
# list of touched files, which it does one at a time, regardless of
# what's behind it in the queue.
