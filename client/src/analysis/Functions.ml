 * unsafe if any of its callees (the functions it calls) itself calls an unsafe
 * function. The functions that we know are unsafe are the builtin functions
 * that are marked as unsafe.
 *
 * You can think of this as a callgraph. The bottom of the callgraph are
 * functions that dont call any more functions (and thus are safe) or are
 * builtins (and thus have a flag to tell us if they are safe).
 *
 * So to figure out the complete set of unsafe userfunctions, we start at the
 * bottom of the callgraph, from the unsafe builtins. Then we go up the tree,
 * and mark any callers of those functions as unsafe. And that's the whole
 * algorithm. *)
