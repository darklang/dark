- [x] Tidy migration 

- [ ] Fully kill the idea of user types, consts, fns
      Everything should be in package space.

- [ ] Split up "handlers" into separate tables

- [ ] stop referring to package thigns by name. refer to them by ID instead.
  - [ ] how do we do that for


- [ ] Review Apiserver endpoints
- [ ] Add endpoints for package stuff
- [ ] Write the dark editor canvas as if we have everything (sketch all endpoints, dbs, etc), comment a lot of it out 
- [ ] Sketch out new built-ins
- [ ] reconsider if we need ExternalTypesToPrgoramTypes and Types... or if we should just use ProgramTypes


tables
	Types
	Values
	Functions

	Even a type and a function are values, though...

	Types are values of the type type
	Functions are values of the function type
	Http handlers are values of the HttpHandler type
	Crons?
	Workers?
	How do traces fit in?
	Hmmm
